                <section id="EarlyLife">
                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <span id="sentence-8">Saint Patrick's parents were Calphurnius and Conchessa.</span>
                <span id="sentence-9">Calphurnius belonged to a Roman family of high rank and held the office of decurio in Gaul or Britain. </span>
                <span id="sentence-10">Conchessa was a close relative of the great patron of Gaul, St. Martin of Tours. </span>
                <span id="sentence-11">when he was sixteen years old, Patrick was carried off into captivity by Irish marauders and was sold as a slave to a chieftain named Milchu in Dalriada, a territory of the present county of Antrim in Ireland, where for six years he tended his master's flocks in the valley of the Braid and on the slopes of Slemish, near the modern town of Ballymena. </span>
                <span id="sentence-12">He wrote in his "Confessio" that during his captivity, while tending the flocks, he prayed many times throughout the day:</span>
                

                <blockquote id="prayer-1">
                    "and His fear increased in me more and more, and the faith grew in me,<br>
                    the spirit was roused, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers,<br>
                    and in the night nearly the same, so that whilst in the woods and on the mountain,<br>
                    even before the dawn, I was roused to prayer and felt no hurt from it,<br>
                    whether there was snow or ice or rain; nor was there any slothfulness in me,<br>
                    such as I see now, because the spirit was then fervent within me."
                </blockquote>

            <span id="sentence-13">The ways of a benign Providence—the six years of Patrick's captivity—became a remote preparation for his future apostolate. </span>
                <span id="sentence-14">He acquired a perfect knowledge of the Celtic tongue in which he would one day announce the glad tidings of Redemption, and, as his master Milchu was a druidical high priest, he became familiar with all the details of Druidism, from whose bondage he was destined to liberate the Irish race. </span>
                <span id="sentence-15">Admonished by an angel, after six years, he fled from his cruel master and bent his steps towards the west. </span>
                <span id="sentence-16">He wrote in his "Confessio" that he had to travel about 200 miles, and his journey was probably towards Killala Bay and then onward to Westport. </span>
                <span id="sentence-17">He found a ship ready to set sail and, after some rebuffs, was allowed on board. </span>
                <span id="sentence-18">In a few days, he was next to his friends once more in Britain, but now his heart was set on devoting himself to the service of God in the sacred ministry. </span>
                <span id="sentence-19">He then visited St. Martin's monastery at Tours and the island sanctuary of Lerins. </span>
                <span id="sentence-20">He put himself under the guidance of St. Germain at Auxerre; a few years later, that great bishop ordained him. </span>
                <span id="sentence-21">The Holy See commissioned St. Germain to combat the Pelagian teachings in Britain, he chose Patrick as one of his missionary companions. </span>
                <span id="sentence-22">During these missionary endeavors, St. Patrick's thoughts turned frequently to Ireland. </span>
                <span id="sentence-23">He had visions of the children from Focluth, crying to him: </span><span id="prayer-2">"O holy youth, come back to Erin, and walk once more amongst us." </span>
                <span id="sentence-24">St. Celestine had entrusted the mission to Ireland to Palladius, who had abandoned it to the fierce opposition of a Wicklow chieftain. </span>

                Germain recommended Patrick to the Pope. 
                Shortly before his death, St. Celestine sent St. Patrick and his companion Segetius to Ireland, laden with gifts. 
                He gave them his blessing, supported them with his authority, and many relics. 
                He gave him the name "Patercius," thus prophesying that he would become pater civium, the father of the people. 
                St. Maximus ordained him a bishop in Turin. 
                Around the summer of 433, Patrick and his companions landed in Ireland. The Druids were at once fighting against him. But Patrick didn’t get discouraged. The brave missionary set out to seek more welcoming territory in which to continue his mission. 
                First of all, however, he would proceed towards Dalriada, where he had been a slave, to pay the price of ransom to his former master, and in exchange for the cruelty endured at his hands to impart to him the blessings and freedom of God's children.<br /><br />At the mouth of the River Boyne, he performed his first miracle on Irish soil, to confirm the dignity of the Blessed Virgin and the Divine birth of her Son. The natives received the Gospel in their own tongue with joy.<br /><br />Leaving a companion with the fledging Christians, Patrick then hurried to Strangford Loughand, where he left his boat and continued by foot. A chieftain named Dichu intercepted him and drew his sword to slew Patrick. Dichu's arm became immobile until he professed obedience to Patrick. His would-be murderer became his first convert, offering his large barn as the first sanctuary in Erin. In later years Patrick cherished returning to this site, where a monastery and church were built. It retains its name Sabhall even today.<br /><br />As Patrick approached Slemish, he was horrified to see the burning mansion of his former master Milchu. An ancient record of the event reads: <q><i>His pride could not endure the thought of being vanquished by his former slave.</i></q>
                Dichu told Saint Patrick that the Supreme Monarch of Ireland had invited the chieftains of Erin to celebrate a feast. Patrick prepared to strike Druidism at its heart. In 433, on the Feast of the Annunciation, and the Eve of Easter, Patrick arrived at the hill of Slane and kindled the Paschal Fire. The King had commanded that no fire be lit that day. The Druids prophesied, "O King...this fire, which has been lighted in defiance of the royal edict, will blaze forever in this land unless it  be this very night extinguished."
